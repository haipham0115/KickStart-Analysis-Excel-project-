**Report**
Conclusion:
1.	Most of the projects are in the category of theater. And theater also has the most successful projects.
2.	The sub-category Play has the most projects compare to all other sub-category. Moreover, the difference is really large: 1066 projects, compare to 260 projects of Rock (the second largest sub-category)
3.	Throughout the year (January to December), it looks like there is a positive correlation between the amount of successful and failed projects. However, at the month of December, there are more failed projects than successful ones. One possible explanation for this observation is that December is the months of holidays; there is a lot of spending on holidays shopping; that could lead to less available funds for backers to support projects. 

Limitations: 
1.	Not all project has the same length of crowdfunding period
2.	The set contains raw data. We don’t have the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects; we don’t have normalized data set (for more proper comparisons between categories or sub-category). With some more processed data, we can have deeper understanding and broader perspective.

More tables or graph: 
1.	We can have the 100% stacked graph, in order observe the successful rate of each category.
2.	We can see how the backers evaluate the value of a project.  This can be used to determine if the project’s price is reasonable to be successful. We can have another table that use Average Donation data for this matter.
